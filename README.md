## 🔍 Troubleshooting <a name="troubleshooting"></a>

### Common Issues

1. **Backend won't start**:
   - Check if all required dependencies are installed
   - Verify your `.env` file exists and keys are correct
   - Make sure no other process is using port 8000

2. **Frontend can't connect to backend**:
   - Check if `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` is set correctly in `frontend/.env`
   - Make sure the backend server is running
   - Check for CORS errors in the browser dev tools

3. **Resume generation not working**:
   - Check if `python-docx` is installed
   - Make sure your Gemini API key is valid

4. **Job search not working**:
   - Try both JSearch and Adzuna (the app will automatically fall back)
   - Verify your API keys in `backend/.env`

5. **Voice interview not recording**:
   - Make sure you allow microphone permissions in your browser
   - Check browser console for errors
   - If STT isn't working, you can still type your answer

### Getting Help

If you're stuck:
1. Check the backend terminal logs for errors
2. Check the browser dev tools (F12) for frontend errors
3. Verify all API keys are correct
